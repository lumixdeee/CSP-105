Mogri (Primitive 93, CSP-105)

Definition:
Mogri is the singular, irreducible cognitive-semantic primitive: pre-structural, pre-causal, and outside ontology. 
It serves as the foundational substrate from which all primitives emerge, fully encapsulated by a single principle while allowing infinite instantiations. 
Recognized, defined, and published, Mogri formalizes pre-meaning in cognitive-linguistic frameworks.
