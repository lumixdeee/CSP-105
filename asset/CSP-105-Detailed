Notes
Numbering and format

Original primitive numbers (1–105) are preserved for reference and historical tracking.
Each primitive is listed in a 3-line format: name/descriptor, definition, examples.
Dates (in-use vs recognised)

Dates in parentheses indicate approximate cognitive in-use period (when humans likely used or understood the concept) and first formal recognition (when the primitive was explicitly named or systematised).
Dates are rough estimates and intended as illustrative, not definitive.
Mogri (Primitive 93)

Mogri represents the foundational cognitive container for all other primitives.
It is not a derivative primitive and cannot be constructed from other primitives.
Consider it a conceptual runtime environment rather than a specific entity.
Gaps and Reserved Numbers

Some numbers were reserved or missing in the original source (e.g., 13, 14, 17, 81).
These can be filled with new primitives as research or modeling expands.
Conceptual Use

This list is primarily a modeling tool for cognition, AI, and formal reasoning.
The primitives are formal conveniences, not absolute metaphysical assertions.
Users are encouraged to adopt, modify, or omit primitives based on context.
Examples

Examples are illustrative and do not exhaust all possible instances.
They are intended to aid understanding rather than prescribe usage.
Cross-References

Some primitives are conceptually related or overlapping (e.g., 8: Causality / Mechanism vs 102: Causation / Mechanism).
Such overlaps reflect historical evolution and refinement of concepts.
Extensions

Additional primitives, subcategories, or meta-primitives may be appended in future versions.
Reserved numbers or new discoveries can be incorporated without disrupting numbering.
Usage Guidance

Ideal for AI modeling, cognitive frameworks, formal reasoning exercises, and educational tools.
The list is neutral and non-dogmatic, suitable for interdisciplinary application.
Attribution

This compilation synthesizes historical, philosophical, and cognitive sources.
Dates, examples, and interpretations are estimations to facilitate modeling and understanding.
